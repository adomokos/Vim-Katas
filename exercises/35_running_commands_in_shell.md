### Running commands in shell

1. Combine two commands with one shell execution:

`:write !sh` - will write this file (a vim command) and start a shell

2. Sort the content of this text:

```
first name, last name, email
john,smith,john@example.com
drew,neil,drew@vimcast.org
jane,doe,jane@example.com
```

Visual highlight the lines to be sorted
`:'<,'>!sort -t',' -k2` - the sort shell command is used to sort the lines

3. Pull up command history in vim

`q:` will show normal mode history
`q/` will show search history

You can navigate the history with `j`, `k` or arrow buttons and repeat the command with `Enter`.

To close the history window press `:q<cr>`.
