### Exec commands on one or more consecutive lines

Look at this HTML sample:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head><title>Practical Vim</title></head>
  <body>
    <h1>Practical Vim</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

Do the following exercises on the text above:

`:7` - move to line 7
`:print` print current line
`:9p` - move to line 9, print it
`:10d` - move to line 10 and delete it in 1 command
`:8,11p` - print range
`:.,$p` - print from current line ('.') to the end ('$')
`:%p` - % means the entire file
visual select multiple lines, `:'<,'>p` - prints the visual selection
`:/<html>/,/<\/html>/p` - print out everything within html
`:/<html>/+1,/<\/html>/-1p` - without the html tags
