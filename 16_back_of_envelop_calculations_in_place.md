### Back of envelope calcuations in place

Suppose that we've just typed the following:

```text
6 chairs, each costing $35, totals $
```

`A` - append mode  
`<C-r>=6*35` - put the calculation result in register  
`<CR>` paste the result at the cursor  

You should get this:

```text
6 chairs, each costing $35, totals $210
```
